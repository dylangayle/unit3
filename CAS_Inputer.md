to create table, use markdown table generator 


### Criteria A: Planning

Context of problem:

The problem recieved was a general problem with person who do CAS in ISAK. Persons did not update their CAS Portfolio regularly so I decided to help up with situation through creating an app that inputs your reflections or just what you do into your website.

Client statement, what is your client already using, what do they NEED?
My client is Abdirahman and he was already using WIX but he asked if I could try and help him to find a more efficient way to input his information.

Proposed Solution 
What programs are you going to use, what language, generally what are you doing?
I decided to use python and kivy because this is what I think is the most advantageous way for me seeing as though this is what we have been working on in class.

Justification for solution 
Why are you using your program, language, why that?? etc etc
Kivy is just an easy way to create apps and it also helps a lot with the client having a high quality.

### Criteria B: Design 

UML, ER, Flowdiagram, System flow thing, any drafts or designs you did, etc. 

### Criteria C: Development 

Most important parts of your code explained

### Criteria D: Functionality 

Here is a video of you testing your program 

### Criteria E: Evaluation 

## Alpha Testing 

put table checking success criteria, input/ output/ 

## Beta Testing 

same thing but someone else should be doing it for you instead of you doing the test 

## Unit Testing

Test but only for ONE section of the code, make sure its isolated
